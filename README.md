### üß† Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

    1.Complex and difficult-to-remember web3 URLs.
    2.Unauthorized or fraudulent transfer of web3 URL ownership.
    3.Limited adoption and accessibility of web3 technology.
	
### üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

This solution addresses the problem of user-unfriendly web3 URLs, which can be long and complex to remember and type correctly. By using Solidity smart contracts to sell web3 URLs with easy-to-remember names, users can easily access web3 content without the need to remember long, complex tags. This can improve the user experience and make it easier for people to engage with web3 content, potentially leading to wider adoption of web3 technology. Additionally, the use of Solidity smart contracts can provide a secure and transparent way to sell and transfer web3 URLs, which can help to prevent fraudulent or unauthorized transfers of ownership.
