	<p> Please note that this is a test project and not intended to be deployed to production. It serves as a demonstration of the potential benefits of using Solidity smart contracts to sell web3 URLs with easy-to-remember names. </p>
</p>



<h4 align="center"> Introducing a revolutionary way to access web3 URLs with ease and simplicity! With our web3 website powered by Solidity smart contracts, you can now purchase web3 URLs with memorable and easy-to-remember names like "kyle.eth" instead of complicated and forgettable tags like "0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8".

## üßê About <a name="about"><a/>

### üß† Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

Most of all repository badge list was already preset with a default styling and didn't give the user the ability to customize freely.

### üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

To solve this problem, the website I created shows all the badges in real-time with a configuration section, so users can have fast visual feedback while customizing.

Using mainly the technologies Next.JS and Tailwind.css for the project, I'm incredibly thankful for all of the libraries creators I used on this project, like Zustand for storing states, RadixUI for accessible components, superjson for easy communication between client side and server side, fuzzysort to search on lists, SWR for fast fetching and infinity scrolling support along react-infinite-scroll-component.
